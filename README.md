# server-sinatra

## Learning Objectives



This is the beginning of week3 at Makers Academy. We're learning how to create servers, define HTTP, write  
basic HTML and CSS and understand the fundementals of web development.

In this excercise, using a framework, [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/intro.html), we are creating a local server and laying the foundation for a basic site. The following code launches the server and allows us to see our code within the browser.

```
ruby app.rb
```

To ensure a clean *seperation of concerns* we set up our file structure like so and store HTML  
within the index.erb file. This ensures clarity and seperation of languages within our webpage  
code.
